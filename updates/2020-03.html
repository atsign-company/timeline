            <h2>The @ Company Update - March 2020</h2>
            <p>It is definitely some difficult times with Covid-19 and all its ramifications. First, we hope you and
                your family and friends are all safe and well during this difficult time.&nbsp; We are fortunate in
                that we designed our business with a virtual office. We did this so that we could attract the best
                talent that we know, no matter where they are located. So the locking down of the country has had no
                impact on our business for now. We are still driving hard, but we just have a few more people in our
                homes!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Website</strong></p>
            <p>We have a new website look that is more fun and playful which should go live this week.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Registrar</strong></p>
            <p>It is up! Our registrar site is up and running. We are just finishing the testing and then we will open
                it to those who reserved their @sign. Around mid April we will send out some invitations so that other
                people can start signing up for their @signs. The site will be invitation-only while it is in Beta.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fundraising and Development</strong></p>
            <p>We are very pleased to announce a partnership with Renascence Development. Renascence will be helping
                us build out the core technology. We now have a team of four full time plus two shadow developers in
                addition to @colin and @kevin coding.They are also investing in our SAFE round. They have a great
                team of core technology developers that will help build out our SDKs, to make it really easy for
                developers to support the @ protocol.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
            <p>We have built out a Kubernetes cluster in Google's cloud to host the registrar website and have been
                working with SunStoneDefence to provide both security and &ldquo;are you a human&rdquo; capability
                that is way more fun than identifying shop fronts or traffic lights. We have built a web server that
                can speak the @ protocol on the backend to query in realtime public data held on @servers, this is
                the basis of the FindMe web service.</p>
            
            <p>We have also added another verb and set of tools to the @protocol which allows public private key
                authentication and encryption of application data. The pkam: verb will be the verb used by
                applications speaking to @ servers so was a very important addition to the protocol.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sources of Revenue</strong></p>
            <p>There are many ways to monetize the ecosystem that we are creating, so we laid out our plan and all the
                different options in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ky2e6_v5qMFE59Z9Z-AH6JhRD65eZC1FLDLt7cTavDQ/edit?usp=sharing">this
                    document</a>. If you want to understand more about our go to market, please
                see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mqi85ryL7j2GGLKI7LInV55MSym9per3QNg4ICXzzI/edit?usp=sharing">this
                    document</a>. As always, we welcome comments and input.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Apps Status</strong></p>
            <p>We are building some apps and we have some outside developers working on apps. We will be paying
                commissions to developers if people buy their @signs through their app.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Find Me app, will probably be the first app available. This app will let you set up your public
                    information and show it on our website or embed it on your own site.</li>
                <li>We are also creating a special version of the Find Me app for influencers, that will let them
                    consolidate all their brands and their offerings in one place.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttvNpz9XAmM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Julz Vault app</a>
                    may be the second one available. This is the app that allows executives to share sensitive data
                    with their executive admins safely.</li>
                <li>The Buzz app, a new version of contacts and groups will take a little longer, but we are all looking
                    forward to that one!</li>
                <li>LifeSite - A digital vault app for sensitive documents, currently selling b-b-c will be extended to
                    work with the @ protocol.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you have any questions or advice, please reach out to me (@barbara), @colin, @kevin, or @k. If you
                have time on your hands, please spend some cycles thinking about any of our updates and let us know
                your thoughts, recommendations or ideas for applications! We love that some folks might have some extra
                brain cycles right now, so feel free to reach out.</p>
            
            <p>We hope everyone stays safe!</p>
