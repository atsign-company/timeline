            <h2>The @ Company Update - October 2020</h2>
            <p>Our big launch is scheduled for Tuesday! Wow, a year ago we had a bunch of ideas and a pitch deck. Today
                we have core code, apps, infrastructure, a website, a developer site, and developers building more apps
                as well as revenue! Thanks to an amazing team and our incredibly supportive investors.</p>
            
            <p>In preparation for the launch, our <a href="http://www.atsign.com">new website</a> is live. We really
                appreciate all the feedback that we received. We hope that you will take a look and let us know your
                thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>We also have a new version of our registrar site. This one includes an option for $10 @signs and more
                invitations to share with friends. Please have fun playing with our free @sign generator. On Tuesday
                you should be able to activate your @sign. Then you can play with our @pps and share with your family,
                friends, colleagues &amp; followers.</p>
            
            <p>Our first @pps are in beta in the Apple and Android store @persona, @buzz, &amp; @mosphere we expect
                them to be released for general availability right around Tuesday. We have lots of enhancements planned
                for them already and we have 15 more in the pipeline!</p>
            
            <p>We also have a launch @talk on Tuesday Oct 27th at 2pm pdt focused on
                privacy. <a href="https://lnkd.in/gdU9uUp">Sign up here.</a></p>
            
            <p>As you know, we believe that to be a great success it takes a village (ecosystem) and I am happy to
                report that we have an @magic village driving us forward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 companies working with us on different attestations</li>
                <li>5 large corporate companies working with us on integration with some of their existing enterprise
                    systems</li>
                <li>2 reputable institutions working on developing @company training</li>
                <li>5 teams competing in our @ppathon</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Here is a clip from our latest
                @talks: <a href="https://youtu.be/vZJC1Ok8aJg">https://youtu.be/vZJC1Ok8aJg</a></p>
            
            <p>Our technical team is super busy preparing for Tuesday, so we will update you next month on all the fun
                techy stuff.</p>
