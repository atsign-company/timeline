            <h2>The @ Company Update - December 2020</h2>
            <p>I hope this holiday season finds you and your family well!</p>
            
            <p>I want to tell you about our @persona app. This is an app that lets you set up your public profile. We 
                held an internal contest on profiles. Here are the winners, and a few more for your amusement:</p>

            <p>We decided to extend our competition to outside developers this month and to anyone who wants to join, 
                so grab your @sign and set up your public profile! You can join one of our workshops if you would like 
                some help getting set up: There is one scheduled for Wednesday, Dec 30th at 10am PST. Please 
                contact <a href="mailto:denise@atsign.com">denise@atsign.com</a> to find out more.</p>
 
            <p>Additionally we had another amazing <strong>Demo Day</strong> on Friday! What really struck me was how 
                we have reached across the globe and engaged developers from all around the world in <strong>envisioning 
                    the future internet, </strong>and that future is really<strong> bright!</strong> This session was 
                an <strong>amazing exchange of ideas</strong>, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
            <img src="img/attached.png" alt="attached app">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://youtu.be/VcLGAZK0QEA">https://youtu.be/VcLGAZK0QEA</a></p>
            
            <p>We are making great strides in our business development, including four diverse Hackathons scheduled 
                for Q1 2021 with universities like Stanford and University of Zimbabwe (government sponsored!) In 
                addition, we have attestation providers signed and interest from corporations for app ideas which 
                are applicable across many industries.</p>
            
            <p>On the fundraising side, we are well into our Series A raise. We have meetings set up with VCs in 
                January, but we are happy to include a few more angels. If you know of anyone who might be 
                interested, please let me know.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Apps status</strong> - We are implementing four cool new features to the @persona app to 
                make it more interactive and viral that we plan to release very quickly. These are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ability to more easily add rich media content to your public profile page.</li>
                <li>A simple means to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; another @sign and include them on your @persona page.</li>
                <li>Private P2P notifications when someone you follow updates their @profile so you know to check it out!</li>
                <li>Choice of themes and improvements to the layout of the @persona web pages.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>We have also released updated versions of the @persona and @mosphere apps to the App Stores that include
                a lot of bug fixes and improvements, most notably to the process of pairing apps with your @sign to
                make it clear and less error prone (still more to do).</p>
            
            <p>Renascence is still working to make the important @buzz app into a great @pp prior to fully releasing it.
                We are excited about what they are building and look forward to seeing it in the market as soon as possible.</p>
            
            <p>The Take@Vote app, created by one of our former Bermudian interns, is in the process of getting into the
                App Stores for beta testing. We look forward to your feedback as soon as we are able to get it to you.</p>
            
            <p>The @rrive location sharing app is now in development by GeekyAnts and looks really amazing!</p>
            
            <p>Lots more apps are coming soon, including new versions of @mospherePro designed for commercial users,
                and one funky little app we call the &ldquo;dude app&rdquo;, so please stay tuned for announcements as
                they are released for testing &mdash; you will be the first to know!</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>For developers</strong> - We started a <a href="https://discord.gg/nKzXvAVbtZ"><strong>Discord
                Server</strong></a> where developers can interact with each other which is proving to be very popular.
                If you are a Discord fan, please join in the conversation.</p>
            
            <p>We are also busy keeping the open source <a href="https://github.com/orgs/atsign-foundation/dashboard">GitHub
                repo</a> up to date and are now publishing libraries and UI components to the Dart and Flutter package
                manager <a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages">pub.dev</a> to make it super easy for
                developers to incorporate and use our SDKs, libraries and widgets in their apps.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@operations - </strong>Following the outage we had due to CloudFlare last month we have moved
                all of our operational DNS to NS1.com. NS1 provides high resiliency and automatic failover if any
                individual server fails. NS1 is in production now for both our websites and all of the secondary servers.</p>
            
            <p>One of the challenges of running individual @servers is that they all need cryptographic certificates.
                The certificate renewal is now fully automated thanks to ZeroSSL and the use
                of <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot </a>from the EFF.</p>
            
            <p>For a while now we have been working with SunstoneDefense as we wanted to make sure we could not be
                attacked by robots. Normally this is achieved with a &ldquo;Captcha&rdquo;, something that asks you to
                click the pictures with shopfronts or lamp posts. That is never fun, so instead while using our website
                you might get asked to slide a security card into a slot or put your @sign in a bag, which is a much
                more fun and easy way to prove you are not a robot!</p>
            
            <p><strong>@core protocol - </strong>We have published a contacts library, which means that any @sign
                contacts you enter on an @pp will automatically appear as contacts in your other @pps. We have also
                been working hard on non repudiation of data, and we have cryptographic proof that even public and
                unencrypted data was created by you and has not been tampered with. Expanding this can address a
                lot of the fake content and copyright issues on the Internet today!</p>
            
            <p>Please reach out if you have any questions or ideas that you would like to share!</p>
            
            <p>My best wishes for the end of your year, and have a great 2021!</p>
