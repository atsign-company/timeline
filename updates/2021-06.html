            <h2>The @ Company Update - June 2021</h2>
            <p>Wow, where did June go? I hope this email finds you well! The @ Company turned 2 in June and I
                celebrated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-full-years-magic-barbara-tallent/?trackingId=tw3zf4Z%2FSny6dCRnIpOhvQ%3D%3D">
                    a post on @magic</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Lead with Free</strong></p>
            <p>We decided to lead with free @signs and make it easy for people to get them directly in the @apps. This
                was implemented first in @buzz, and we have updated the at_onboarding_widget and published it to pub.dev
                so that other apps can start using it. Expect all the @apps to be updated soon.</p>
            <p>Our registrar site is currently being updated to lead with free @signs as well.</p>
            <p>We have also been working on our next iteration of our developer site
                (<a href="https://atsign.dev">https://atsign.dev)</a>. After taking into account the feedback that we
                received from the community, we added plenty of new technical content to make it easy for the
                developers to find what they are looking for. We plan to launch the new site in a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p>We had a really fun Demo Day on Friday. Our participants in Africa always have a bit of a connection
                issue, but their apps are brilliant! If you are not on the Demo Day list and want to be, please let
                me know. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZCny-S3rfA8T4p7DEQjKCLZJVEYIuTx">Here is a
                    playlist</a> of past Demo Days, including Friday&rsquo;s. We will load all future recordings of
                Demo Day here.</p>

            <p>We ran some intense focus groups, <a href="https://wavi.ng/@project_21">idea sessions</a>, and
                <a href="https://wavi.ng/@blowyourmind_22">feedback gathering</a> for @buzz this month. Denise and
                Tinashe did an amazing job running those and gathering feedback and ideas for how @buzz can be used.
                When you can share information completely privately and safely, you share much more than you would
                online today!</p>

            <p>You may have noticed that some of the links above go to wavi pages. I just love all the creative uses
                for wavi pages. You get much more of a feel for someone&rsquo;s personality from their wavi page. Here
                are some more of my favorites:</p>

            <p>We have a really exciting hackathon with a group of doctors in July called FHIR @hack
                (<a href="https://fhirathack.devpost.com/">https://fhirathack.devpost.com/</a>). Who better to lead
                the way to a Privacy-First Internet than the medical community? We have more than 120 registrants
                from all over the globe signed up for the event and a great panel of judges from the medical and tech
                community.</p>
            <p>On to the techy stuff:</p>
            <p><strong>Dart Null Safety:</strong> We have been making solid progress releasing Null Safety
                compliant updates to our published packages. As of now, 9 of the 19 active packages have been
                released with Null Safety on pub.dev.</p>
            <p><strong>More options for installing dess:</strong> One of our interns has been working to ensure
                that the personal secondary server can be installed on just about any combination of
                hardware (x86 or Arm) running a growing list of Linux distributions and in different cloud
                platforms such as Google or Amazon. This enables developers to create their own secondary servers
                within their own development environment and run everything except the root server for @signs.</p>
            <p><strong>@Login and self-sovereign identity:</strong> We never liked the idea of collecting email
                addresses or phone numbers on our registrar site, but we had to start somewhere. While you can
                already login using an @sign, we still rely on an email or SMS one time password (OTP) verification.
                We are currently developing @Login:a zero-trust, passwordless mechanism that eliminates the need to
                store any data about our customers at all. This is called self-sovereign identity. The next step to
                deliver on this is to release the @Login app and implement @Login with our registrar site as the
                first test case. The @Login app will also let you control how we should contact you should the
                need arise. After we perfect the system, we will make it easy to integrate into any website in a
                similar manner to traditional SSO mechanisms. We have another company interested in using this
                functionality for IOT devices.</p>
            <p>I wish you the very best!</p>
