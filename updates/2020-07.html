            <h2>The @ Company Update - July 2020</h2>
            <p>Dear Friends,</p>
            
            <p>I hope you are well and staying healthy.</p>
            
            <p>Here is the fun news from us this month:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial patents have been filed with multiple claims, which is a really big step for us. The current
                    plan is for 7 additional filings. Great work by Kevin, Colin, and the dev team!</li>
                <li>Our seed round is well oversubscribed at $3M and is now closed.</li>
                <li>We only have one week left with our interns. We are fortunate that some will stay on with us going
                    forward. We have learned so much from them and love having their perspectives.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS9s05ISur0">Here is an @ Company overview video</a>
                    created by the interns.</li>
                <li>Version 2.0 of our registrar for mobile devices will be available this month and thank you to all
                    who gave us a lot of excellent feedback.&nbsp; We will let you know when it is available for you to
                    share with everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Our priority this next month is apps in beta. If you want to be involved in our beta testing process,
                please let me know! For more details on the apps, please see below.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Apps</strong></p>
            
            <p>Apps Going to Beta</p>
            <p>@me Our interns <a href="https://youtu.be/NUxrzBhby1s">created this great demo of the @me app</a>.</p>
            <p>@buzz Our contacts app will be next.</p>
            
            <p>Apps in Development</p>
            <p>With the interns that are continuing this Fall, we&rsquo;ll be working to develop --&nbsp; @chats,
                @location, @votes and @fileshare!&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Outreach to App Developers</p>
            <p>A big focus for our business development efforts this summer is on outreach to individual and boutique
                or &ldquo;studio&rdquo; app developers. We have two interns who will continue on as @Student
                Ambassadors to help create and expand our dev site. We are also exploring and initiating MeetUps,
                Training Courses, and Hackathons.&nbsp; If you know of any developers or companies who are creating
                innovative applications (willing to respect privacy and data ownership rights) and could benefit from
                an additional way to make revenue, please let me know!</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Influencers</strong></p>
            
            <p>Rachel Sawden has joined us as an advisor. Rachel is an influencer and created some great materials to
                help other influencers. She is helping us understand how to work with influencers and how to create
                apps that would be helpful for them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Attestations</strong></p>
            
            <p>We have been working with SunStone Defense to secure our registrar site from attacks, including botnets.
                A happy side effect of this is that we will have our first attestation (isHuman) that @sign owners can
                use as proof that the @sign was created by a real human.</p>
            
            <p>We have made some additional progress on attestations, it turns out there are national non-profits, such
                as the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators and the National Association for Public
                Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) that aggregate driver licenses, birth certificates,
                social security numbers and more. We are in early discussions with NAPHSIS and they are working on a
                proposal for us to attest for age using their Electronic Verification of Vital Events database.</p>
            
            <p>Read on for all the great technical progress:</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Core Protocol</strong></p>
            
            <p>Good news! The core team has finished producing both a server build and a client SDK (Software Developer
                Kit) with the complete set of verbs implemented and working in unison. We are now working on migrating
                our existing infrastructure and applications to the new codebases.</p>
            
            <p>The net effect of all this work is that developers of applications using the @ protocol and the SDK only
                need to know two things. First, how to include the SDK in their code, which only requires a couple of
                lines of code, and second, what verbs they want to use. The current verbs are very easy to understand:
                &ldquo;update&rdquo;, &ldquo;lookup&rdquo;, &ldquo;delete&rdquo;, &ldquo;scan&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;stats&rdquo;,&rdquo;sync&rdquo; are all pretty self-explanatory for the developer.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>We also have a few really interesting updates to verbs. For example, the scan verb can now accept a
                regular expression and the sync verb now syncs without the need for timestamps.</p>
            
            <p>The interns have been instrumental in creating a new API that provides an interface between the
                registrar site and our infrastructure services. This will be a key part of the activation process
                together with the @me application that binds the @sign on a mobile device to the cloud microservice
                with full control literally in the hands of the owner of the @sign.</p>
            
            <p>It is so satisfying to see all these components coming together and working together as a system &mdash;
                that's how protocols should work, but it is nonetheless very exciting.</p>
