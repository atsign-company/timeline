            <h2>The @ Company Update - September 2021</h2>
            <p>Our new version of the registrar site that allows people to get @signs is working great. If you have time, please <a href="https://atsign.com">hop over to our site</a> and get a free @sign. I would love to hear your feedback on the process and which @sign you were able to get. My free @sign is @wonderfulpelican.&nbsp; Along with the new registrar, we have a widget which allows you to easily get free @signs from within any of the @apps being developed on the platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Traction</strong> - We had 500 people acquire their new @signs in July/Aug, doubling from May/June. We are on track to double that again to 1,000 for Sept/Oct!</p>

            <p><strong>App Progress</strong> - Next month I will be talking about several apps that will be in the App Store and Play Store that you can use with your @signs.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Developer Community</strong> - Meanwhile, we continue to grow our developer community and work with them on their very cool app ideas. We added a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UMpnONLpHA">new Runtime video</a> (a bite-sized video) to help developers get started on the @platform. Plus we did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COIVYFkjoDc&amp;t=380s">live coding Runtime</a> video with Majid Hajian (Google Developer Expert for Flutter and Dart).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Our development community saves substantial time and money by running on the @platform instead of building their own infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Speaking of infrastructure, we picked Dart for writing our initial code and created our first SDK for Flutter for many reasons, not the least of which is the rapid growth of those communities. But Dart is also a good choice for infrastructure development. For more information, check out Chris Swan&rsquo;s article - <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/wtf-are-dart-and-flutter">WTF are Dart and Flutter</a>?</p>

            <p>This month, Colin put together a way to integrate the @platform with his ham radio hobby. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ohDSg4Dqw">Check out his video here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>The Company</strong> - As we work to fundamentally change the internet, we are also working on building a very unique company, fundamentally changing the traditional way of working. Here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/flat-organization-people-part-iii-barbara-tallent/?trackingId=zy5kcl7u5ft%2FuvCsoo3V4w%3D%3D">my third post</a> on building a flat organization - it is all about the people!</p>

            <p>Now onto the techy stuff:</p>
            <p><strong>rSDK (resilient Software Development Kit) and Updated Secondary Servers Rollout</strong></p>
            <p>We have updated all of our secondary servers to work with the new rSDK changes. This last week, the team has been primarily focused on working with app developers to take advantage of the new methods that provide the status of notifications and sync operations to improve their customers&rsquo; experience. So far, the rSDK has proved to have solved a number of problems that we have been facing for a long time. The uptake has been pretty painless with fewer bugs and issues than expected. Developers do need to make changes to their code, but the end result is far superior and actually results in code reduction in the apps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>The at_app Skeleton App Generator</strong></p>
            <p>Xavier has created an important tool for app developers that creates a skeleton Flutter app with some basic @platform capabilities easily, from the command line. The tool is based on the Flutter create command line tool that is very popular amongst developers. We currently include a template with the minimum requirements of an @platform application, with the option to add more templates in the future as needed. It works right out of the box so that developers can get started faster than ever. Oh, and Xavier is a full time student as well - amazing!</p>

            <p>That is it for this month, I&rsquo;m looking forward to telling you more about the apps next month.</p>
