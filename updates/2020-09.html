            <h2>The @ Company Update - September 2020</h2>
            <p>I hope you are staying well!</p>
            
            <p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the docudrama The Social Dilemma
                (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0</a>),
                it is really worth a watch! Our timing for The @ Company could not be more perfect.</p>
            
            <p>Here are this month&rsquo;s highlights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We kicked off our first @ppathon! Denise managed to send out invitations to 72 universities and we
                have over 40 sign ups from all over the world. Applications are due Monday. Here is a
                <a href="https://appathon.atsign.com/">link to the @ppathon</a>.</li>
                <li>This @talks session featured a discussion of our Early Access Program. Our next session will
                discuss our @ppathon.<br />

                <li>Our updated website (including a new registrar) should be launched early next week. Special thanks
                to all who gave their feedback!</li>
                <li>We have our data room set up for raising our next round of funding. Please let me know if you are
                interested in participating and we will schedule an update for you and grant you access to the virtual
                data room.</li>
                <li>Jory Des Jardins, our new CMO, hit the ground running, so expect to hear some fun marketing news
                next month and see her influence on our new website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three apps are scheduled to be available for our launch:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>@persona (formally @me) - Your public profile set up, currently in beta</li>
                <li>@buzz - Contacts and groups reimagined, currently in alpha</li>
                <li>@mosphere - Completely private (peer to peer) file sharing, currently in development</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>And now for the tech deep dive:</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Core Protocol</strong></p>
            <p>We&rsquo;ve progressed on two fronts this month. The first is the implementation of the stream verb
                and the second is a deep focus on further security controls.</p>
            
            <p>The stream verb was been the last core protocol verb to be developed, and that is because it is very
                tough to make it both functional and easy to use. The first app to use the stream verb, @mosphere,
                enables person to person, real time, end-to-end encrypted file transfer. Usually with file transfers,
                you transfer a file to somewhere and then the receiver picks up the file from that &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;.
                We are used to Google drive, iDrive, Box, and Dropbox keeping all our files stored up in the cloud.
                The downside is that your file is sitting somewhere out of your control. But in our app, the stream
                verb&nbsp; streams the file from the sender&rsquo;s device to their @protocol server. The receiver
                then connects to the sender&rsquo;s @protocol server and accesses the streamed file. The file never
                is stored; it is only streamed packet by packet and is encrypted end-to-end. It is cached at the
                receiver end and can be removed by the sender at any time.</p>
            
            <p>The streaming part is pretty straightforward, but the notification and security around each of the
                events is what needs real-time notifications and security at every step. Fortunately, last month's
                work with the notification and monitor verbs was leveraged to solve those challenges.</p>
            <p>We are currently testing the streaming verb and working with the partner who is developing the @mosphere
                secure file transfer app. The two teams are meeting every day and we are all excited to see the end
                product.</p>
            <p>Security is close to our hearts, as well as the use of well-known and trusted security technology and
                techniques. One of those technologies is the use of TLS to provide encrypted connections between
                processes. Most frequently used for web browsers and web servers, TLS provides standards based
                encryption, but it can also be used to authenticate clients. Just as a web browser checks that the
                website you are connecting to is the one you selected, the same check can be applied to clients. This
                is exactly what we have implemented in the @protocol.</p>
            
            <p>When an @server connects to another @server, the connecting certificate and the serving certificate
                are confirmed to be accurate and matched against the expected DNS name in the CN or the SAN fields
                of the respective SSL certificates. This closes spoofing of connections and another classic internet
                attack known as <em>amplification, </em>as the pol verb will be acted on only if the certificates
                match.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cloud infrastructure</strong></p>
            <p>We have been building out the production cloud infrastructure and have decided to use Google&rsquo;s
                Cloud, GCP.&nbsp; This decision was based on GCP&rsquo;s ability to provide multi-datacenter
                infrastructure and the ability to scale alongside us.</p>
            
            <p>Kubernetes (GKE) provides multi-datacenter redundancy in a region (Iowa in our case) but that
                redundancy is invisible to us. It just <em>automagically</em> works &mdash; thanks Google! In a
                similar fashion, we will be building out the Docker Swarm infrastructure as well in the coming days
                and weeks.</p>
            
            <p>Backups and business continuity have been given a lot of thought, and we&rsquo;ve decided to
                continue with our strategy of using Amazon's AWS cloud as our backup and BCP platform. Each of
                our systems are backed up to AWS and in the very unlikely event of problems in GCP we can rebuild
                in AWS.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@apps</strong></p>
            
            <p>The primary library that application developers use, the AtClient library, has been condensed into a
                single inclusion into the flutter pubspec.yaml. The methods have also been reduced and simplified
                so app developers can use them more easily with their apps.</p>
            
            <p>At this point, we have 13 apps in various stages of development. The upcoming @ppathon will add to
                this list, and we have also a very long list of apps that we would like to get into development. This
                is in support of the goal of three apps ready at launch and one to two per month thereafter.</p>
            
            <p>There are so many other things going on in the technology stack including strengthening the developer
                environment, additional focus on testing, bug finding efforts, and integration efforts bringing
                everything together. The teams are all busy for sure, but everyone is having fun and excited to show
                the world what we have been doing.</p>
            
            <p>Wishing you well!</p>
