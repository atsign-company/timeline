            <h2>The @ Company Update - February 2021</h2>
            <p>I would like to invite you to get your @sign up and running so that you can play with some of the apps. 
                I am happy to schedule a Zoom session to help you get your @sign activated so you can try some of the 
                apps in action. Please let me know if you are interested. We have been doing these sessions with Kim 
                Perdikou and they are always a lot of fun!</p>
            
            <p>I just got to play with the @buzz contacts app and I am super excited about this app; it is going to be 
                a game-changer for contacts. Hopefully we can get that out in public beta very soon so we can all play 
                with it together.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>@sign traction:</strong> The @sign registrar numbers &mdash; especially the free ones for 
                developers &mdash; are growing at a rate of ~22% a month over the last 6 months!!&nbsp; Our original
                forecast was 10-12% a month, so we are exceeding that so far.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://atisgn.com"><strong>New Website</strong></a></p>
            <p>The marketing team worked really hard on our <a href="https://atsign.com">new website</a>. You can 
                now see if your @sign is available, right from the home page. We would love to hear your feedback.</p>
            
            <p>Ok, now for the platform and developer updates:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Developer traction&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We officially reached over 400 Developers on Discord. Since the end of 
                    January we have close to tripled our numbers (from 115 to 400+), thanks to the hackathons,
                    Flutter events, and #30daysofflutter campaigns.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>There was a lot of excitement around the @ platform at Stanford&rsquo;s Tree Hacks this month -

                <li><a href="https://twitter.com/atsigncompany">Twitter</a> has been very active of late, thanks to a
                    lot of love from the leaders of the Flutter community. If you are a twitter user, please join the

            <p>The theme for @ppathon II is to build a super useful app that uses the distinguishing features of the
                @protocol. Through Tinashe, who is from Zimbabwe, we were able to partner with the Computer Society of
                Zimbabwe. We have now selected 24 teams to join the @ppathon:</p>
            
            <p>15 Teams from Zimbabwe</p>
            <p>5 Teams from Stanford University&rsquo;s Tree Hacks</p>
            <p>1 Team from SB Hacks</p>

            <h3><strong>@apps</strong></h3>
            <p>We are all eagerly awaiting the release of all the new and updated apps and here's the latest status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>@buzz - in private beta and looking great</li>
                <li>Take@Vote - in private beta</li>
                <li>@mospherePro - in private beta</li>
                <li>@rrive - in private beta</li>
                <li>Version 1.2.3 of @persona has been released with support of multiple @signs. The ability to follow
                    others and optionally share who is following you will be released soon. We will also be changing
                    the brand of the app from @personal to @space - please let us know what you think.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>For developers</strong>: Running an open-source project means that we should be using the
                open-source code in production and this month we can say we are. The production environment now is
                built on the public source codebase. So if you see an issue in production then any developer can
                help fix it!</p>
            
            <p>Having demonstration code is always useful (and we have some example code in
                the <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos">demo repo</a>), but what is even nicer
                is a full application. So, we have open-sourced the @mosphere codebase which can be
                found <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/atmosphere">here</a>. More applications will go
                open-source in the future, and the next one is likely to be @persona.</p>
            
            <p>Using multiple @signs in a single @pp was always possible, but now it has been implemented in the
                @persona app, allowing you to manage all your @signs on
                <a href="http://atsign.directory">atsign.directory</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@operations: </strong>We have had a good month operationally, and we did hit the magic 99.999%
                overall uptime for our core infrastructure (<a href="http://status.atsign.com">status.atsign.com</a>),
                although because it's a moving target we do of course get hit with the odd problem.</p>
            
            <p>Our website was hit with an outage for 3 minutes where responses were slower than expected. We
                use <a href="http://kinsta.com">kinsta.com</a> for the website and they continue to provide excellent
                service, but together we could not find the cause of the slowness for those three minutes.</p>
            
            <p>We also did have an outage on the registrar website where people could not register new @signs. That
                issue was a result of human error on our part. We fixed it quickly, and anyone who had a problem was
                contacted personally.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@core protocol:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>We also have a number of things in the test environment that will be published soon. These include a
                completely re-engineered notification subsystem, the migration of the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; file from
                a .zip file to a .atKey file, and a much easier onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>What we have already published is a newly written PKAM utility. This allows you to login by hand into
                your @server by providing you with the cryptographic answers to login with the pkam: verb. You can find
                that code in the <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_tools/tree/pkam_tool/at_pkam">at_tools </a>repo.</p>
            
            <p>Sorry that was so long! Believe it or not, this is a cut down version. Thank you for joining us on this
                journey.</p>
