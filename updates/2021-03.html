            <p>I really struggle to bring you just the highlights of what is happening 
                at The @ Company because there is so much good stuff going on! Here is my attempt at a summary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Great developer traction</li>

                <li>The @buzz app should be in the app stores next week. It is still at beta level, but we have had
                    so much fun playing with it in Zoom sessions. Let me know if you want to join us to get you up
                    and running with the app.</li>

            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>

            <p><strong>For developers</strong>: Updates have been the main focus of this month for developers. Out of
                the 26 libraries and applications we have in the open source community, 13 have been updated with more
                features. We have also open sourced a new demo app that shows how to use some of those new features,
                the at_cookbook. The cookbook app allows people to share recipes, so it&rsquo;s both&nbsp; a great demo
                and useful too.</p>

            <p><strong>@operations &amp; @protocol core: </strong>It&rsquo;s been a very interesting month from an
                DevOps perspective, with some seemingly strange performance issues at the start of the month.</p>
            <img src="img/load_monitoring.png" alt="load graphs" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;">
            <p>Back last year we met with the SVP of Engineering at Slack.com to get his perspective on running a
                global service. His advice was to measure everything, especially customer key touchpoints. We took
                status.slack.com as a model and put up status.atsign.com, which shows if the infrastructure is up with
                a customer viewpoint.</p>

            <p>Behind the scenes Slack measures and graphs everything, so we also did the same for our infrastructure,
                but we still have more to do across our whole stack. But when we started to notice issues of secondary
                slowness, we referred to the measurements and could see a pattern which helped us engineer a solution,
                put it in place, and see the results. We also learned that we needed another key measurement which is
                now added. Thank you Allan for your wisdom back in 2020!</p>

            <p>What was the root cause? We rolled out the notification subsystem 2.0 update, which used a little more
                memory than the previous version, so the triage fix was to increase that limit on the microservice.</p>
            
            <p>Even more interestingly, as we looked into this issue we discovered another deep in the internals of
                Dart.</p>
            
            <p>When we send data into a TLS/TCP stream we expect it to pop out at the other end without seeing any
                network errors or retransmits. But what we actually saw on large transfers like sync operations were
                retransmits and errors. It made no sense; we had tested this all in the past.</p>
            
            <p>After further analysis we discovered that this was a symptom, not a cause, and that the way we were
                buffering by adding objects together got very inefficient as the objects got larger. This in turn
                applied back pressure to the network, hence the network errors.</p>
            
            <p>The first fix is to simply change the way to add to the buffer, which worked very well, but has led to
                us thinking about not buffering as much and dealing with objects as they arrive. While that sounds
                simple, it's going to be a great engineering task for next month for the core team!</p>
            
            <p>In summary, development and operations merged this month and we ended up with some amazing lessons and
                solutions that improve experience and keep our memory footprint very tight on the @server microservices.</p>
            
            <p>If you have read this far, I am impressed! Happy to connect with you any time if you have any questions
                about all the fun things we are working on.</p>
