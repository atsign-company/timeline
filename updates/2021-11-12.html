        <h2>The @ Company Update - Nov/Dec 2021</h2>
        <p>As we wind down the year, we have a lot to be thankful for at The @ Company. We have had so much progress, and so
    much help from everyone in the community, we want to say a heartfelt thank you to all of our supporters and friends!
    We can’t wait to see what 2022 will bring.</p>

        <p>Here are the November/December highlights:</p>

        <h2>Staff</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We are honored to have Gary Casey, from Google, join us this month. Gary’s deep technical expertise will
        help us take the @platform to the next level and make sure it is completely scalable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Traction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is our goal to double the number of @sign every two months, so our goal for October/November was
                2,000 @sign sign ups. We ended November with 2,662 new @signs, 600 over our goal!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Patents</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We received an email from our patent attorney saying, “This is either a happy Haunakkha present or an
                early Christmas present.” We received full indication of allowability on all 20 of our patent claims!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Positioning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We have officially adopted “flip the internet” as our positioning.</li>
            <li>We are working on a new version of our website that should be up in December incorporating the new
                positioning.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>Techy stuff</h2>
        <p><strong>Developer Journey</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - We have kicked off a concentrated effort for the month of December to begin focusing more on developer adoption. We have started by defining a target developer persona and a conceptual model of what the journey from discovery to actual implementation of our tech looks like, so that we can optimize their experience. For developers looking for a solution to some particular problem, we want to make it easier for them to understand the intent of the @platform, how it might be applied to their use case, and, most importantly, try it out for real to see how easy it is to implement.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved documentation with a focus on SEO optimization.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Try it now&rdquo; for all packages requiring less than 2 minutes to set up a working example.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation of these runnable examples as templates with the at_app CLI tool.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase trust from other developers by focusing on the &ldquo;first followers&rdquo; and making it as easy as possible for them use and share the platform.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <pre>&nbsp;</pre>
        <p><strong>Dependability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -&nbsp; Availability, Reliability, Security, and Privacy are the key aspects of the dependability of the @ platform as a whole, and we are continuously evolving our tech and infrastructure to make improvements across all these dimensions as we learn from real world experience.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more automated testing has been a big focus of ours over the last couple of sprints and will continue to be. We are building a platform that needs to be 100% dependable so that developers and entrepreneurs can rely on us. Automated test coverage is a major part of this, and although it's not shiny, it is critical to our success.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <pre>&nbsp;</pre>
        <p><strong>Scalability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - We had a couple of service outages this month which have prompted us to reassess some earlier choices of technology providers.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We currently use Ubuntu as our Linux distribution for our Docker Swarm clusters, but we are finding that cloud-init causes excessive load under certain conditions on the worker nodes. So we are testing </span><a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flatcar Linux</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is purpose-built for container workloads.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our certificate partner</span><a href="https://zerossl.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ZeroSSL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has had a number of outages over the last few months so we are migrating back to </span><a href="https://letsencrypt.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LetsEncrypt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and using ZeroSSL as a backup. We are also working on pre-generation of certificates so we do not have to rely on either provider being up.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <pre>&nbsp;</pre>
        <p><strong>Operability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - As things continue to increase in scale, we need to have confidence that new releases work as expected and do not introduce new issues in production.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have built what we are calling our &ldquo;canary cluster&rdquo; using Flatcar Linux worker nodes to both test run the new distribution and test new builds on our own @signs before we roll out builds to the whole world. This is part of the progressive delivery workstream Chris has been leading.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <pre>&nbsp;</pre>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for your incredible support throughout 2021. We are humbled and appreciative!&nbsp; Wishing you and your families a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you in 2022!!</span></p>
