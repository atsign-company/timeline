            <h2>The @ Company Update - August 2020</h2>
            <p>There is @magic in the air. We welcomed two new amazing members to our team this month and extended our
                relationship with many of our interns:</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dr. Henna Karna</strong>, <strong>board member</strong> - Henna has held several executive
                    roles across 3-4 industries, leading digital transformation in three Fortune 100 firms. Today, she
                    runs Data, Analytics, business and digital transformation for AXA, which is a $170B firm spanning
                    152 countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Jory Des Jardins,</strong> <strong>CMO</strong> - Jory has more than 20 years of experience
                    building startups. She co-founded, grew, and exited the women&rsquo;s influencer media company,
                    BlogHer, and then advised dozens of emerging tech, consumer marketplaces and communities. Most
                    recently she led marketing for the blockchain company ConsenSys and the Startups group at AWS.</li>
                <li>Interns - two of our Interns joined full time!! Esther, Hakeem, and 11 others will be working as
                    many hours as their educational schedules allow. Most will be with us through the end of December.</li>
            </ul>
           
            <p>I also have two fun videos to share:</p>
           
            <p>We have app demo days on Friday every other week. If you are not on our invite list and would like to
                attend occasionally, please just let me know and I will add you. Here is a video of our first official
                app demo day:</p>

                <br />@demoday</a></p>

            <p>We have also started a Q&amp;A with the founders every other Friday that we call @talks. @talks is soon
                going to evolve with guest speakers. I&rsquo;m happy to invite you to that as well, or you can just ask
                your question in the <a href="https://pigeonhole.at/FP4TDD">Pigeon Hole here</a>. This is our first
                @talks:</p>

                <br />@talks</a></p>
           
            <p>Denise is working hard to launch our first <strong>@appathon</strong>, so stay tuned for news on that.</p>
           
            <p>Speaking of videos, some of our former interns have kicked off our social media channels. Since these
                channels are run by Gen X, I guarantee that they will be more interesting than if the founders ran
                them! Here they are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjSJbPmIEDXFbHb2RIj9Gg">YouTube for Developers</a> -
                    run by &ldquo;The Tylers&rdquo;</li>
                <li><a href="https://twitter.com/atsigncompany">Twitter</a> - run by Hakeem/Esther</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/atsigncompany/">Instagram</a> - run by Hakeem/Esther</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/atsigncompany">LinkedIn</a> - run by Esther</li>
                <li><a href="https://medium.com/@eskao/google-says-my-data-is-worth-12-6026bb4b60f0">Medium</a> - Esther
                    has started her own @blog</li>
            </ul>
           
            <p><strong>Special Note:</strong> We are just getting ready to raise our next round. If you know of an
                early stage investor who is interested in participating in something really big, please email me
                directly.&nbsp;</p>
           
            <p>Now for the @tech news:</p>
           
            <p><strong>@ Core Protocol</strong></p>
           
            <p>This month has been really exciting as we are joining the work streams together from different teams
                and seeing codebases interacting.</p>
           
            <p>Some examples are compiling, testing, and automatically deploying the core protocol, the @me application
                using that core infrastructure, and the @me web interface displaying public information input into the
                @me app.</p>
           
            <p>If that sounds like a lot of work and complexity, it is, but it also all works! Of course it is not
                without the odd bug. As we find those bugs and fix them the latest code automatically gets recompiled,
                tested and pushed to the infrastructure. This is all needed for automation and scaling of our platform
                to be ready for launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           
            <p>All this works because of the core team&rsquo;s discipline of managing branches of code, and that in
                turn allows multiple streams of work concurrently. This is also a measure of the maturity and the speed
                of development. In the early days we had just two branches of code. Now we have one per-sprint-branch
                and then development and production releases.</p>
           
            <p>There has been no let up in pace on the creation of <strong>new features either</strong>, with the
                addition of caching of information shared with other @signs and critically, the revocation of that
                sharing and deletion of the shared information. All the new features exponentially enable new
                application possibilities in the future and are only limited by @ app developers creativity.</p>
           
            <p><strong>@ App Developers and the Software Development Kit</strong></p>
           
            <p>We started learning with the intern program how application developers would adopt the @ protocol and we 
                learned a lot! We are continuing to learn as the members of our Early Access Program - young developers
                with huge ideas and no fear - start to work &amp; create applications with the @ protocol.
                &ldquo;The Tylers&rdquo;, two of our former interns, are running the program and providing videos and
                code examples to help the EAP developers be productive and as fast as possible.</p>

            <p>The biggest thing we have learned thus far is that while we meet developers who want to use the protocol 
                directly, others just want to use the features of the @ protocol without having to know the gory details.</p>
           
            <p>With that in mind this month we have developed a second higher level client API which abstracts the 
                protocol to simple CRUDS operations. Create, Read, Update, Delete are simple well known operations but 
                for good measure we added Scan.</p>
           
            <p>Both the lower level API and the new higher level API work seamlessly; this new SDK further removes any 
                perceived barriers of entry to using the @ protocol and speeds up the application developers adoption 
                time and time to market for their MVP (minimal viable product).</p>
           
            <p>As always, the months are flying past but we are making huge progress and appreciate everyone coming on 
                this journey and adventure with us!</p>
           
            <p>Stay well.</p>
