        <h2>The @ Company Update - October 2021</h2>
        <p>It has been quite a month for The @ Company. You won&rsquo;t believe what
            this amazing team of people have accomplished. Here are just the highlights.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traction </strong>- It is our goal to double the number of @sign every two months,
                so our goal for Oct/Nov is 2,000 @sign sign ups. We are currently at 2,475 @sign signups and we
                are only half way through!&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Met with Vint Cerf</strong> - This was definitely the highlight of our month for Henna,
                Colin, Kevin, and myself (thank you Henna!). Vint was the inspiration for The @ Company creating
                an internet with both anonymity and accountability. We really look forward to continuing that
                conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Panel</strong> - On Global Encryption Day, Henna Karna hosted a panel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8MKipz022k">The Future of the Internet and Encryption</a>. This was such a great discussion with incredibly impressive participants, definitely worth watching!</li>
            <li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - We had some incredibly successful hackathons (which were the biggest contributor to @sign sign ups) this month including:</li>
            <li>Cal Hacks</li>
            <li>Hack this Fall (India)</li>
            <li><strong>Wavi contest </strong>- One of the highlights of Hack this Fall was our wavi contest. Here are
                the winners:</li>

            <li><strong>Demo Day</strong> - After a brief pause, we restarted our Demo Day series and expanded it to include a panel discussion led by Don Witt. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIG0uSJySMI">panel and the hackathon winners here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Apps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The future of file sharing is here!</strong> - @mospherePro is working great and is in the stores (Apple and Android). You won&rsquo;t believe how easy it is to send multiple files to multiple people - completely end-to-end encrypted. I&rsquo;d like to make a personal offer to help you get up and running with this product. Just let me know when you want to try it out.</li>
            <li><strong>The @buzz app has finally been approved for release in the Apple store</strong> - Managing contacts will soon be a thing of the past, we are so excited about launching this game changing app!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Posts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top Flutter Companies</strong> - For the second year in a row we were listed by Very Good Ventures as one of <a href="https://verygood.ventures/blog/top-companies-using-flutter-2021">the Top Flutter Companies</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Flat organization</strong> - I&rsquo;m continuing to document our journey in building a flat organization. My latest post is on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/flat-organization-making-decisions-part-iv-barbara-tallent/">making decisions</a>. I also did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNpGAsFn7oE">this short video</a> for Tech(k)now Day as a brief overview of the flat org.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip the Internet </strong>- Are you looking for a short explanation of what it is that The @ Company is working on? Here is a <a href="https://atsign.com/resources/white-papers/a-brief-overview-of-the-platform/">quick summary</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a Flutter App with No Backend</strong> - <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/building-flutter-apps-with-no-backend-9715b764a81e">This article</a> by Anthony and Xavier got a lot of love from the Flutter community.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>More</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outage</strong> - With all this great stuff there was one real nail-biter. We had an outage in the middle of Hack This Fall. Colin will go into some detail in the techy stuff below. These are fabulous learning opportunities - growing fast is hard, but we have the right team working on this!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Now, on to the techy stuff:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>100% uptime for the latest hackathons </strong>- After the outage, the later hackathons and events did not encounter any fundamental blockers for the developers that participated in them. This is a great demonstration that the hard work to improve the reliability and usability of the SDKs, widgets, and tools is paying off.</li>
            <li><strong>Google&rsquo;s Dart team recognized Chris Swan&rsquo;s work - </strong>Chris created a multi architecture Docker build for the Dart language. Chris was asked to raise a pull request to the Dart language GitHub repository so his changes could become part of the official Google build. <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-docker/pull/53">https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-docker/pull/53</a>&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Outage 5:25 PM Thurs Sept 21st till 2:20PM Friday Oct 2nd PDT -</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this time many secondaries were down, and at one point all secondaries were down as we reset the cluster&rsquo;s networking configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What happened -</strong> A combination of two things. First, a new Secondary server build, which moved from a purely in-memory database to an in-memory index and data on disk strategy. Second, an increase in the number of secondaries, due to the increased traction. The combination of the two resulted in secondaries failing and restarting, which in turn put pressure on the infrastructure. We saw load averages that normally settle in at 1 to 3 bouncing in the high teens during the first few days of running the new code, then on Thursday sky rocketing to over 100 and the Docker swarm cluster was not able to recover without intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>How we reacted -</strong> Clearly we had to revert our code back, so the core team produced a build that went back to the in-memory model but kept all the bug fixes from the previous build. We also took the opportunity to upgrade and increase the number of worker nodes from 6 to 12. We knew that the latest version of Docker had an MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) issue on GCP (GCP interfaces are set to 1460 not 1500!). To fix this, we changed the MTU of the Docker swarm Ingress network and took the cluster down then put it back up.</li>
            <li><strong>The platform has been stable since the outage </strong>- We have re-looked at our decision to move completely to index in-memory and data on disk. The next build will have some databases fully in-memory and others just the index.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Wow, can&rsquo;t believe that is just one month, this team is unstoppable and I feel so fortunate to be able to work with them!</p>
