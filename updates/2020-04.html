            <h2>The @ Company Update - April 2020</h2>
            <p>I hope this finds you well and safe during these difficult times.</p>
            
            <p>The @ Company continues to make some great progress even during these difficult times. Here is the
                latest update.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Website</strong></p>
            <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been to our new website, please check out <a href="https://atsign.com">atsign.com</a> and give us feedback.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Registrar</strong></p>
            <p>We have worked through many of the bugs with the registrar site and are ready for more people to try
                it out. If you reserved an @sign with us and haven&rsquo;t bought it yet, let me know and I will make
                sure to get you an invite. If you want to reserve an @sign or just try out the registration, please
                let me know. We have some really fun free @signs to pick from as well as premium @signs.</p>
            
            <p>We are just one month short of our first year and we already have revenue!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
            <p>In preparation for release as open source, the whole @ protocol stack has been reviewed and a fully
                abstracted software specification has been developed by the Renascence team. This allows the same
                software architecture to be used in the future but the ability for us or third party developers to
                use other underlying components.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>For example, for the root server we use a Redis database because it&rsquo;s fast and scalable, but in
                the future if a new technology is better we can now easily move just the database interfaces without
                touching any other code. This fully abstracted code base is being developed rapidly and the new root
                server code is now fully functional, the next two sprints will be dedicated to the secondary code base
                and we feel that much of the root code methods will be reused which reduces our codebase and the chance
                of bugs.</p>
            
            <p>Testing has also been a focus for the Renascence team and we now have unit and functional tests written
                and automated for the @ protocol stack which helps both the old code base and the new as we transition.
                The great news is that as new and old code base both talk the @ protocol everything interacts and works
                seamlessly, which is expected behaviour but very nice to see.</p>
            
            <p>On the infrastructure side we continue to leverage Kubernetes for both the @ protocol and for the
                website infrastructure. We have experienced outages at both Digital Ocean and Google our cloud
                providers, but Kubernetes continues to redeploy and recover from issues for us.</p>
            
            <p>Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and automation are very important to us and we
                are using <a href="https://buddy.works/">buddy.works</a> for the website automation and Jenkins for the
                @protocol automated testing. The buddy.works pipelines are fully deployed and tested allowing our
                developers to push code and the website to be built and deployed automagically.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Applications for the Ecosystem for Launch</strong></p>
            <p>We have two more applications to add to the list since our last report.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>File transfer - a secure, surveillance free file transfer app that feels like AirDrop&trade; for
                    iPhone or Nearby Sharing&trade; for Android, but it works between all devices and locations, not
                    just between same device platforms over a LAN connection.</li>
                <li>Dude app - a sample app to help developers get started. The app can only do one thing and that is
                    to send a peer-to-peer &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pond5.com/sound-effects/item/41593958-dude-usa-female">dude</a>&rdquo;
                    sound to another @sign user with the app. The app is mainly intended to be a useful example, but we
                    also want it to be fun and actually show up in the App Stores.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Note: we are now calling the &ldquo;Find Me&rdquo; app &ldquo;@me&rdquo;; with a mobile version for
                managing public and private settings and personas and a web app for sharing them publicly with others.</p>
