            <h2>The @ Company Update - May 2021</h2>
            <p>Well the @magic is in the air! We have closed on our seed funding round and that announcement will come
                out shortly.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Free @signs in the apps</strong></p>
            <p>We decided after all the input that the onboarding process was way too complex, so now you can get
                started immediately and get your free @sign from right inside the app, in just seconds!</p>
            
            <p><strong>@buzz</strong></p>
            <p>We have been experimenting with @buzz and found a platform problem with the protocol which appeared as
                instability in the apps, but it was rooted in flaky network connections. The core team got right on it
                and we expect to have a fix out next week which will enable all @apps to function on even the most
                unstable network connections. But the good news is that @buzz looks awesome! I can&rsquo;t wait to try
                it with you.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@wavi</strong></p>
            <p>We rebranded @persona to @wavi &mdash; your public space on the Privacy-First web. Soon we will have a
                way for people to discover your @wavi page (only if you want to be discovered of course!) Here are some
                fun @wavi pages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://wavi.ng/@laurabakerphd">@laurabakerphd</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://wavi.ng/@jory">@jory</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://wavi.ng/@thenorthernsoulcombined">@thenorthernsoulcombined</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Now that the round is closed, we are working through how to maximize our resources to drive adoption.
                It is important that we preserve the amazing innovative culture of our company in our next phase of
                growth. We are learning more about how to do this and are becoming fans of the &lsquo;middle managerless
                organization (MMLO)&rsquo; mode. Here is a
                <a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/how-to-organize-a-large-organization-without-middle-management/">good
                    article</a> that describes just what that means.</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>For developers:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Writing our code in Dart/Flutter has a number of huge advantages, including being able to run on pretty
                much any device and reuse code from the server side to the mobile device and back again seamlessly. But
                because both Dart and Flutter are also being developed as we develop our code, we have to keep up with
                the latest builds and ensure our code can take advantage of the latest versions. Null Safety is one such
                example.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Null Safety: </strong>Both Flutter and Dart have had some major changes in the last few months as
                Flutter hit the 2.0 milestone. Along with that milestone is something called &ldquo;Null Safety&rdquo;.
                Null Safety has the advantages of faster code and less chances of software failures, but we do have to
                rework all of our code to be null safe. Dart/Flutter developers have seen some of the larger packages
                becoming null safe and we are doing the same. It&rsquo;s a bottom up task, so the lower level libraries
                need to be completed first and the widgets come at the end. It will take a while for us to complete
                everything but we are doing it so as not to be in debt!</p>
            
            <p><strong>@operations &amp; @protocol core:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Another form of technical debt is operational. To ensure that we keep everything clean operationally
                in our CI/CD we are fully utilizing GitHub.com. GitHub has a number of features that help us, including
                GitHub actions, which have been used to automate everything we can including building code, testing,
                and pushing to production. This can all be seen in our GitHub repos (for example
                the <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_server/actions">at_server repo</a>).&nbsp; The more
                we automate, the less technical debt we have as we grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>We have been investigating ways we can make the @protocol more reliable under less than perfect network
                conditions. We have focused on the notification and the monitor verbs and hope to roll out the new code
                very soon. Behind the scenes, the monitor verb code will take note of the last notification it saw and
                if the TCP connection drops, it can re-establish and know it has not missed anything. Similarly, the
                developer can know if the notification that they sent was actually received, along with retry strategies.
                The ultimate aim here is that the developer will not have to worry about network problems when the SDK
                and the @protocol are capable of handling them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>dess:</strong></p>
            <p>We mentioned last month we were working on some software to enable people to run their own secondary
                servers on the hardware platform of their choice. We released the distributed edge secondary
                server (<a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/dess/tree/dess.0.0.1-release.1">dess</a>) this
                month. People are providing feedback and we will enable the UI part of the registrar website to point
                your @sign to your infrastructure as soon as next week.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Atsign.dev revamp: </strong>We are in the middle of revamping our developer website to improve
                the quality and usability of our documentation and related resources that developers need to understand
                and make use of the @platform. You can see what we are working on at the
                atsign.dev <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/atsign.dev">repo</a> if you would like a sneak
                peak.</p>
            <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Making things nice for external contributors: </strong>Many of these items
                are being done to improve the organization and hygiene of our open source repos in order to enable and
                encourage our growing community of developers to contribute to them.</p>
            
            <p>We are making progress on our exciting journey and thank you all for joining us on the adventure!</p>
