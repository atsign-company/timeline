            <h2>The @ Company Update - July 2021</h2>
            <p>We did our first live stream of <strong>Demo Day</strong>on Friday, which you can
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1Z_CzPjCHI">watch it here</a>. This event featured our
                interns and hackathon participants showing off their apps. Imagine having an end-to-end
                encrypted app that you can demo in just two months!&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Funding</strong> - here is our announcement on our most recent<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/internet_optimists_secure_8_million_to_create_a_more_human_internet/prweb18049878.htm">

round of funding</a>.
                We welcomed Kirk Brown to our board of directors!</p>
            <p><strong>Culture</strong> - as we grow the company it is really important to us to make sure the
                company stays nimble, efficient, and fun. We believe that the flatter the company, the more
                productive it can be, for a number of reasons. I&rsquo;ve started writing some posts on our
                adventures of growing a flat organization that you can read here:<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-truly-flat-organization-beginning-barbara-tallent/?trackingId=%2BDgnXcfdWmJ4%2BQWlguPwaw%3D%3D">

            <p><a href="https://fhirathack.devpost.com"><strong>FHIR @hack</strong></a> Fast Healthcare Interoperability
                Resources - we partnered with MayJuun (a group of doctors who are also technologists and are
                focused on streamlining HealthCare data) and had an extraordinary hackathon. We had more than
                235 participants from around the world, 38 <a href="https://fhirathack.devpost.com/project-gallery">
                    project submissions</a>and 27 teams that pitched live to an amazing group of judges.
                All the winners from the hackathon will now be part of a mentorship program led by both companies.</p>
            <p><strong>Wavi pages</strong> - here are just a couple of the amazing wavi pages that came out of FHR @hack:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://wavi.ng/@90daily">@90daily</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://wavi.ng/@10sound">@10sound</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://geekle.us/flutter"><strong>Geekle event</strong></a> - we participated in this Flutter
                and Dart community event earlier this week that had more than 4000 global participants. We did a
                session on &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/RvFStiPmKkI?t=2325">End to End Encrypted Everything</a>
                &rdquo; and also ran a scavenger hunt for the attendees. We also made a wavi page just for the event
                (@gs21ðŸ’™e2eee) check it out<a href="https://wavi.ng/@gs21%F0%9F%92%99e2eee">here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>@buzz and @mospherePro testing</strong>- this week we tested @buzz and @mospherePro.
                @mospherePro lets you send multiple files to multiple people - all end-to-end encrypted. We loved
                them both! Honestly, even though @buzz is designed to share contact info, we ended up using it for
                photo sharing. It was just so much fun to post photos in our personas. Both worked quickly and
                flawlessly - congratulations to both teams!</p>
            <p><strong>New Developer Site</strong> - we are now live with a new and improved developer site
                (<a href="https://atsign.dev">https://atsign.dev</a>). The new site provides developers with tons
                of documentation and content, and provides the ability for the open source community to contribute
                to the documentation itself as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Bonus</strong>- our Discord community just crossed 750 developers! We had started Discord on a
                trial basis back around Thanksgiving of 2020 and now it has become our home for the @ platform
                community. We welcome you to <a href="https://discord.gg/eNYPh5MbAX">join us</a>.</p>
            <p>On to the techy stuff:</p>
            <p><strong>Getting free @signs within any @app </strong>are now possible using the latest release of the
                onboarding widget which uses a published API on the registrar website to allow people to select a
                free @sign quickly and simply (although we do ask for an email at present, we will not even ask for
                that in the near future). This has been integrated into the latest versions of the @buzz and @wavi
                (on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atsign.at_settings">Google Play Store</a>
                and via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/1PtzPJbv">TestFlight on the App Store</a>) apps.
                Please have a look and let us know what you think.</p>
            <p>We have completed virtually all of the migration to the <strong>Dart null safety</strong>requirement
                for our published packages. The remaining ones are due to external dependencies and will be updated
                as soon as the dependent packages are released that comply with null safety.</p>
            <p><strong>Docker swarm</strong> <strong>mode</strong> is the technology we use to run and manage the
                thousands of microservices on the @platform. A couple of months ago we were contacted by the
                Docker team to say we were using it a little too much. We cycle around each microservice regularly
                to ensure it is running the latest code and each time we were doing that we pulled information from
                <a href="http://dockerhub.com">Dockerhub</a>. Docker late last year changed the way they monetise
                and one new way is charging for pulls over
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates">certain limits</a>.</p>
            <p>This month, we implemented a caching proxy for Docker images that only pulls images if an update
                is required. This way the Docker team is happy and all our secondary server microservices are
                kept up to date automatically.</p>
            <p><strong>IoT ARM and SIM cards. </strong> One of our advisors connected us with a company in the
                Internet of Things market that has deep experience with Subscriber Identification Modules (SIMs).
                The idea of using SIM cards to store the @signs cryptographic keys is really interesting, as
                is using the ARM processor versions of <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation/dess">dess</a>.
                It is early, but we both see the potential for really interesting solutions where IoT devices become
                part of the &ldquo;End-to-End Encrypted Everything&rdquo; vision of the company.</p>
            <p>The<strong>Stream verb</strong>is used to connect two @signs via a secondary and provide, what looks
                like to each device, an end to TCP socket connection. In actuality the secondary is relaying the IP
                packets between the two devices and can see the data being exchanged. To solve that problem we only
                encrypted data across the TCP socket. But what if the developer did not have to do that and the SDK
                took care of it? Enter the use of AES256 streaming mode and Dart&rsquo;s converters and codecs.&nbsp;<br />
                We can now ensure an encrypted stream from device to device, even if the developer does not encrypt
                the data before sending. While working on that code we also solved the problem of failed network
                connections forcing us to restart a whole download. As AES256 does not increase the number of bytes
                transferred, the stream verb asks for the starting point of the transfer, so if just the last two
                bytes got lost, they can be requested.</p>
            <p>The stream verb updates are in testing and will go into production soon.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Monitor verb</strong> has been made more robust and, like the stream verb, it can now
                reconnect and ask for any notifications it may have missed. This functionality is also in testing.</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s it for this month, I wish you the very best!</p>
