            <h2>The @ Company Update - February 2020</h2>
            <p>The @ Company has had another great month! Below is a summary of our progress:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
            <p>We have decided to change the term we use to refer to @handles to @sign. It is lighter, friendlier, and
                goes better with our domain name of atsign.com</p>
            <p><strong>Fundraising</strong><strong><br /></strong>Thanks to our amazing chairman of the board, Kim
                Perdikou<strong>, </strong>our SAFE round is just about done at $2.5M. Thank you to all of our
                fabulous investors!</p>
            <p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
            <p>More great progress on the technology side:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We now have end-to-end encryption working with the protocol</li>
                <li>We now have a variety of sample apps to show developers how they can implement the components</li>
                <li>We also have push notifications figured out, which will allow surveillance-free peer-to-peer push
                    notifications</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Registrar</strong></p>
            <p>Our beta registrar site is almost ready to go. We had a delay as we wanted to make sure the design was
                fun and engaging, and so we brought in an outside designer to turn this vision into reality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have almost 100 reserved @signs already!</li>
                <li>New launch date for beta registrar is March 15</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Go to Market</strong></p>
            <p>We have fleshed out our go to market strategy and have a more detailed document available. We love
                input, so please take a look and share your thoughts with us!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Apps in Progress</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The &ldquo;Find Me&rdquo; app - a fun way for influencers to share all their social media links in
                    one place under a single brand.</li>
                <li>LifeSite - A digital vault app for sensitive documents, currently selling b-b-c will be extended to
                    work with the @ protocol</li>
                <li>Contacts - peer-to-peer contacts and groups, will be built on the @ protocol</li>
                <li>Julz Vault - An admin needs access to highly sensitive executive&rsquo;s information. There is no
                    secure, easy way for them to retrieve or keep this data. Sticky notes, storing in their phone
                    contacts (where it could be shared in vcard), handwritten paper lists, or cloud documents are all
                    insecure and easily compromised. A peer-to-peer sharing app, where the exec never loses control of
                    this sensitive data. Juliette Gomez will be promoting the app at their PA awards dinner in March</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you want to reserve your @sign (and Kim hasn&rsquo;t already reserved it for you) before the beta
                launch, please let me know!</p>
