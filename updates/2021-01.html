            <h2>The @ Company Update - January 2021</h2>
            <p>Dear @friend,</p>
            
            <p>I would like to invite you to our Demo Day this coming Friday at 8:30 pst. I just found out that all of my favorite apps are on the list to be demoed, so this is a must see demo day! <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82384506814?pwd=UGlHbEVCYWYwWnV2bXluWGEwTC8wQT09">Here is the link</a>. If you would like to have an invite that will go on your calendar, please just reply to this email.</p>
            
            <p>Here are the fun apps that will be demoed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li >Take@Vote: A voting platform to allow @sign owners to share their opinion amongst friends or strangers, in a way that is private and secure</li>
                <li >@baygrapes: Nature based knowledge at your fingertips. A field guide to your local habitats</li>
                <li >@unite: Emergency P2P connection when there is no power</li>
                <li >@Buzz: A peer-to-peer social networking application that enables individuals to present different personas to different people and receive personalized offers from companies they trust</li>
                <li >Att@ched: A completely secure and private app for sharing notes with the people that are closest to you. By using the @ Protocol, the app ensures that you and the person you're attached to are the only ones in the world that can see the shared notes.</li>
                <li >@rrive: A location sharing app to ensure that your location is privatized and secure while sharing with a person or group of people</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>@magic</h3>
            <p>My how the world has changed in just a month. Signal and Telegram blew up this last month and suddenly privacy is hot - so once again we have @magic timing. We haven&rsquo;t yet closed this round, so if you know of investors interested in the privacy space, please send them our way.</p>
            <h3>Business Microsites</h3>
            <p>Last month I showed you some @persona microsites. This month we are focusing on getting business microsites up and running. <a href="https://atsign.directory/@groveson41">Here is an example.</a></p>
            <h3>More Developers</h3>
            <p>The @ platform is gaining great traction with developers, being featured on the GeekyAnts meetup yesterday and <a href="https://t.co/BkH0HOkJf0?amp=1">here is the first</a> of several posts that developers are writing.</p>
            <h3>@apps</h3>
            <p>We are all eagerly awaiting the release of all the new and updated apps and here's the latest status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li >@buzz - currently in private beta test</li>
                <li >Take@Vote - currently in private beta test</li>
                <li >Version 1.0.6 of @mosphere has been released with improved synchronization and status feedback</li>
                <li >Version 1.2.2 of @persona has been released with improved synchronization and a share widget to make it easier to share YouTube videos.</li>
                <li >The atsign.directory microsite web app has been updated with layout improvements and better handling of rich media content.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Please let us know if you would like to be a beta tester (public or private) - the team is eagerly awaiting your feedback!</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>For developers</strong> - Virtual Environment 2.01 is launched and available for developers at <a href="https://atsign.dev/gettingstarted.html">VE2.01</a>. The main difference is the focus on flutter developers and being able to get up and running in as few steps as possible. We have instructions for Linux, MacOS, and of course WIndows.</p>
            
            <p>Non repudiation of public data is now available via metadata, and it will also be available for encrypted data in the coming month.</p>
            
            <p>We continue to add and update the developer libraries we have published to <a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages">pub.dev</a> (currently we have 14 packages published) and we see the popularity %&rsquo;s going up so we know folks are building with them, which is very exciting to see! Most notably, we have added <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/at_contact">at_contact</a> and <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/at_contacts_flutter">at_contacts_flutter</a> as well as <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/at_chat_flutter">at_chat_flutter</a> libraries to make it easy for applications to implement shared contact data and chat messages.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@operations - </strong>Last month's move NS1.com has proved to be a great move and while we have had behind the scenes outages they have been routed around by the NS1 technology so no-one would ever know. We have also had Google rebuild, without warning, our Kubernetes clusters (root server, directory &amp; registrar), no doubt for their own operational issues. All that engineering effort was worth it, everything was fully autonomously handled. We have had some customer affecting problems, specifically with our automated scripts for activating @signs - we continue to improve our monitoring and error handling scripts to ensure that all the services we run have no outages from a customer viewpoint.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@core protocol - </strong>The sync 2.0 code is now in production, this is a complete rewrite of the original sync code and incorporates all the learnings we had from using the 1.0 codebase. The sync improvements are on the secondaries so there is no need to recompile app code.</p>
            
            <p>Our next focus is the notification subsystem, which will bring many to many notifications and further improvements. These changes have been driven by developers of the @rrive app, which is great. Each new application teaches us more about what needs additional build out.</p>
            
            <p>We wish you the very best 2021!</p>
