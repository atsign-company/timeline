            <h2>The @ Company Update - January 2020</h2>
            <p><strong>Technology</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We have made great progress on the technology side (Kevin and Colin are an amazing team!)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The protocol code is working and we have both primary and secondary servers up and running at
                    Digital Ocean</li>
                <li>We have secondary server code running on both phones and in the cloud and syncing between them</li>
                <li>We expect to be able to deliver early SDKs to developers in two weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We have had great feedback from developers who believe the @ privacy protocol solves significant
                problems for them</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://lifesite.co/">LifeSite.co</a> will be implementing the @ protocol and we will offer
                    a free version of their service to everyone who signs up with an @handle</li>
                <li>We have a partner to develop the Julz Vault app (more on that below) and the contacts app, they are
                    anxious to get started and just waiting on code</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Registrar</strong></p>
            <p>We continue to get lots of interest from people who want their @handles</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We plan to have the registrar site up on Feb 14</li>
                <li>We have people who want to pay to reserve their handles today, so we are starting a reserved handle
                    list and are taking payments!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Apps in Progress</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>LifeSite - A digital vault app for sensitive documents, currently selling b-b-c will be extended to
                    work with the @ protocol</li>
                <li>Contacts - peer-to-peer contacts and groups, will be built on the @ protocol</li>
                <li>Julz Vault&nbsp; - An admin needs access to highly sensitive executive&rsquo;s information. There
                    is no secure, easy way for them to retrieve or keep this data. Sticky notes, storing in their phone
                    contacts (where it could be shared in vcard), handwritten paper lists, or cloud documents are all
                    insecure and easily compromised. A peer-to-peer sharing app, where the exec never loses control of
                    this sensitive data. Juliette Gomez will be promoting the app at their PA awards dinner in March</li>
                <li>The apps above are serious apps, we are currently brainstorming ideas for fun peer-to-peer apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fundraising</strong></p>
            <p>Our SAFE round is growing, but we are still taking checks!</p>
            <p>2020 is the year of privacy!</p>
