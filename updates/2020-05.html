            <h2>The @ Company Update - May 2020</h2>
            <p>I hope you are well and staying healthy!</p>
            
            <p>Instead of my normal update, I&rsquo;m just going to share some fun @magic stories and then have
                technical details below for those who want to jump into the tech weeds.</p>
            
            <p>We often use the term &ldquo;@magic&rdquo; because things just always seem to work out great for The @
                Company. The right ideas come at the right time, all the best people just show up, and it all gets
                pulled together with innovative funding!</p>
            
            <p><strong>The story of @interns</strong> - We welcomed a fabulous new member to our team - Denise Daniels.
                Denise jumped right in and put together an intern program. We decided to get two interns for
                development and two for marketing.</p>
            
            <p>Well, we were completely blown away by the number of interns who applied and the quality of the interns.
                Their backgrounds and enthusiasm were so impressive! In fact, there are several interns who want to
                develop their own apps on top of the @ protocol.</p>
            
            <p>We unfortunately only had enough budget for four. But it would be crazy not to harness all this
                enthusiasm and talent for our team. So how to fund hiring more?</p>
            
            <p>Our Board Chair led the way by agreeing to put more funds into our SAFE round to hire two more interns.
                Then even more of our awesome investors stepped up and added more funds to our SAFE round to fund
                interns and Denise also joined our list of investors and contributed funds herself to the company.
                Our program went from 4 to 14 wonderful interns this summer!</p>
            
            <p>We believe this program is something that we will continue to do going forward and evolve it into an
                incubator program. We believe that by combining marketing interns with app developer interns we can
                launch some really fun products into the @market.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The story of the @registrar</strong> - As you may know, we don&rsquo;t have any apps on the
                protocol - YET! But what we do have is people wanting to get their @signs, so we set up our registrar
                site. As with any new software, there were some fits and starts to getting it all working. In fact
                many of our investors were our testers and gave us incredibly valuable feedback!
                <a href="https://atsign.com">The site</a> has now been up for most of the month and people are buying
                their @signs. We even have a few people speculating on names. :) <strong>So I&rsquo;m happy to report
                    that this 11 month old company already has revenue.</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Applications for the Ecosystem for Launch</strong></p>
            <p>The internship program will add some great new apps, but for this month, we have no new applications
                to add to the list since our last report.</p>

            <p>Please share <strong>any ideas for applications</strong> that you would like to see sooner rather than
                later.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Technical progress</strong></p>
            
            <p>Progress continues to be rapid on the @ protocol core components; what follows is a technical deep dive.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Scalable software architecture</strong> - The root server code has been completely rewritten
                using the software architecture designed with the Renascence team and it is now in production. Having
                the new root server code running in parallel with the original secondary code shows the @protocol
                working as designed.</p>
            <p>The secondary servers are the servers that each individual will have running. These servers house the
                individual&rsquo;s core data and pointers to additional datastores owned by the individual.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Testing the core call functions </strong>- The secondary code base is also being rewritten and
                all the core verbs are completed. Automated testing being worked on now, to exercise and test the code
                regularly so that it can be verified before each code push.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Speeding up response at scale</strong> -&nbsp; TCP caching code is almost complete in the new
                code base and the next focus will be the synchronization verbs that allow sync between end devices and
                the secondary.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Addressing scaling issues with secondary servers</strong> - due to the paradigm shift our
                protocol delivers - The cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes continues to solve many production
                problems silently reconfiguring itself to ensure the website and @ protocol components are running
                smoothly. However we have hit some scaling issues with running the @protocol secondaries on Kubernetes.
                During May we have been looking for alternatives and have tested Docker swarm with good results for
                thousands of concurrent secondary servers each with a unique IP/port and manageable individually and
                self healing like Kubernetes.</p>
            
            <p>Whilst doing this scale testing we also looked to optimize the memory footprint for each secondary
                server and we are pleased to report that our current secondary code uses 4MB of memory per instance.
                This is pretty remarkable and allows us to scale and have each individual @sign in its own
                containerized and secure microserver.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Next up</strong> - design and implementation of the &ldquo;notification&rdquo; verb (peer-to-peer
                notifications) and also support for secure streaming connections.</p>
            
            <p>Please let us know if you have any questions or input.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Wishing you the very best!</p>
