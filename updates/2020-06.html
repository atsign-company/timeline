            <h2>The @ Company Update - June 2020</h2>
            <p>I hope you are well and staying healthy.</p>
            
            <p>Here is some fun news from us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our seed funding round was approximately 10% oversubscribed! During this time of uncertainty, this
                    response is amazing and we are very grateful for all the support Thank you all!</li>
                <li>Our <a href="https://www.atsign.com">registrar site</a> continues to generate revenue even though
                    the mobile applications that we&rsquo;re planning are still in development.</li>
                <li>There are some great apps going into beta next month. I&rsquo;ve seen a demo of the Buzz (contacts)
                    app that Renascence is developing and I can&rsquo;t wait to start using it.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some of those great apps are being developed by our interns.</p>
            
            <p>The interns have been fun, inspiring, and creative. On our very first The @ Company birthday, June 11th, 
                all of the interns changed their Zoom background to a celebration background designed by Zara (one of 
                our interns.)</p>

            
            <p>Our Bermuda-based interns were featured in two articles: 
                <a href="http://www.royalgazette.com/business/article/20200622/young-bermudians-hired-by-california-company">Bermuda 
                    Royal Gazette</a> and <a href="https://bernews.com/2020/06/silicon-valley-startup-hires-6-interns-bermuda/">Ber 
                    news</a> thanks to a press release written by Esther, another one of our interns.</p>
            
            <p>All of our interns are doing amazing work and we are so grateful to our investors for supporting this 
                program! Here is a picture of the group:</p>

            <p>The Buzz app development is progressing rapidly and MVP features are nearing completion. Development of 
                the @me mobile application (aka the settings app) is essentially complete and we are working to complete 
                the web version shortly. If you are interested in helping us test this ahead of submission to the app 
                stores, please let us know.</p>

            <p>The internship program will add some great new apps. The current list of applications that they are
                working on is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>@Unite - A standby/standin network application for when disaster hits</li>
                <li>@chats - Peer to peer group chats</li>
                <li>@Onboarding - &ldquo;you should always be ready to be hired&rdquo;.</li>
                <li>@location - peer to peer, surveillance free location sharing.</li>
                <li>Compliance App - helping companies comply with privacy regulations.</li>
                <li>Stream joining - stream content over direct socket to socket p2p connections.</li>
                <li>@Productivity - social media as a productivity improver, not a time waster.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Please share <strong>any ideas for applications</strong> that you would like to see sooner rather than
                later.</p>
            
            <p>For those interested in hearing about our amazing technical progress, please see the information below:</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Core Protocol Codebase</strong></p>
            <p>This month, we focused on the server side codebase and implemented TCP/Socket caching and pooling
                mechanisms that speed up the protocol significantly.</p>
            
            <p>We have also implemented several enhancements in the data storage module, one being the introduction
                of a time to live (TTL) on a record. This allows an update that will automatically be removed after
                a set amount of time. One of the development team members had a very new idea that we have not seen
                before, which was to have a time to birth (TTB): In other words, this would allow a record to appear
                after a set period of time. Both TTL and TTB have millisecond accuracy, and combined TTL and TTB allow
                a new set of use cases that we are only starting to fully imagine.</p>
            
            <p>We&rsquo;d like to add that the synchronization mechanism that we mentioned in our last update has now
                been implemented on the server side code.</p>
            
            <p><strong>@ Developer Software Development Kit (SDK)</strong></p>
            <p>With all this work on the server code, we are focused on bringing these functions to the client
                libraries and the SDK.</p>
            
            <p>Based on the feedback from the developer interns, we have created a standalone full development
                environment that includes every component of the @ protocol but runs on the developers local machine.
                This includes a root database, @ primary server and 13 secondary servers. This allows developers to
                develop full solutions without any dependencies on internet connectivity. The environment can be
                spun up in a few seconds and rebuilt instantly to allow a stable baseline @ protocol environment
                to test against as well.</p>
            
            <p>I hope you and your family stay well.</p>
