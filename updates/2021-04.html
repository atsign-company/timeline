            <h2>The @ Company Update - April 2021</h2>
            <p>Love this quote from <a href="http://technewsworld.com/story/87097.html">this article</a>: "One company
                taking the lead to fix the Internet is The @ Company."</p>
            
            <p>Our @sign registrations are growing over 20% month over month with most being free @signs which aligns
                with our business model.</p>
            
            <p>We have made great progress on our funding and we plan to close the current round by the end of May and
                will provide details as soon as the lawyers finish the documents for our investors.</p>
            
            <p>We continue to immerse ourselves in the amazing Flutter dev community. Here is how that is going:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We announced three <a href="https://atsign.dev/advisors.html">Flutter Advisors</a></li>
                <li>Developers are embracing our tech and <a href="https://mullr.dev/2021/03/27/the-platform-a-firebase-alternative/">spreading
                    the word with the community</a>&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Our developer community on Discord is now over 500!</li>
                <li>We sponsored the Flutteristas event and spoke at the event
                    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGwTfsPDiO0">Youtube Link</a>, timestamp 2:04:36) -
                    This was an amazingly well organized event!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1200+ sign ups for the event.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Average 120+ live viewers throughout the 4 part event</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Last week, we presented our take on &lsquo;Reimagining Payments&rsquo; at
                the <a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/events/the-forum/">PaymentNZ Strategic forum </a>to all the
                leading banks in New Zealand. We have also been engaged in discussions with a team of doctors from
                the <a href="https://www.fhirfli.dev/">Fast HealthCare Interoperability Resources</a> to come up with
                new ideas on improving the patient experience across various aspects of Healthcare.&nbsp; In addition,
                we have been in a number of brainstorming meetings with a company who works with multiple government
                agencies and wants to build device to device communications (the IoT world).</p>
            
            <p>In social media, our Twitter follower count is now almost 1k &mdash; not bad for just getting started!</p>
            
            <p>Here is some additional fun press:</p>

            <p>We are getting ready for our 2021 intern program, which is very different from most companies&rsquo;
                intern programs. Here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-have-intern-program-barbara-tallent/">my
                    post</a> on last year&rsquo;s intern program.</p>
            <p>@buzz is in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renascence.atbuzz">Google
                Play store</a> and in review for the Apple App Store! This is version 1.0 of the app and we have lots
                of requests for additional features, but we wanted to start using it with our friends and families.</p>
            <p><strong>How are we using @buzz?</strong> We realized early on that we were not going to have
                an employee directory (privacy and all). So instead, we are asking everyone to create an @ Company
                persona in @buzz to share with the other individuals in the company. What is really cool about this
                is that people can share so much more than their contact info with others in the company. They can
                share outside interests and what they are currently learning so that everyone can make deeper
                connections with each other &mdash; which is exactly what @buzz is all about &mdash; deeper connections!</p>
            <p>Another great thing about @buzz is that you can retract any information that is out of date or that you
                no longer wish to share, and it automatically disappears from everyone&rsquo;s @buzz app.</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Now for the Techies!</em></strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>For developers</strong>: Just like last month, the focus has been on improving the libraries and
                widgets for developers to use, with the addition of the at_events_flutter (as part of the @arrive app).
                This is a first release that relates to calendaring and group data that can be shared across applications
                and we are excited about how this will be used and improved by other developers.</p>
            
            <p>We updated 11 of our existing packages and also hit another milestone with our first depreciation &mdash;
                the old &ldquo;atsign_authentication_helper&rdquo; library, which still works, but offers a less
                intuitive user experience. In order to use the new and improved &ldquo;at_onboarding_flutter&rdquo;
                library, we needed to update the virtual environment, which has now been completed. To complete the
                migration to the new library, we will be updating all the necessary demos and examples during this
                upcoming month.</p>
            
            <p>We are also working hard on the quantity and quality of our documentation as we get more developers
                looking at our code. So, please check out our in <a href="https://github.com/atsign-foundation">GitHub</a>
                and <a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages">pub.dev</a> repos and add stars and likes
                to them &mdash; it really helps us a lot!</p>
            
            <p><strong>@operations &amp; @protocol core: </strong>We use GitHub to host all our source code and we have
                been increasing our use of its built in tools, like GitHub actions. Actions allow us to test software
                as it is changed or merged automatically. Previously, the tests were run as we pushed changes to
                production through buddy.works.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We have also been working on making our open source repo easier to navigate with many more readme files.
                We are starting to move our code to a trunk based development, which will help us manage releases and
                make it easier for developers to monitor our progress.</p>
            
            <p>If you do want to monitor our coding progress, that too is now open for all to see here
                (<a href="https://github.com/orgs/atsign-foundation/projects/3">sprint plan</a>) on our public repo.
                You will also see that we use tags extensively. We had trouble keeping them in sync across all our
                projects, so we wrote <a href="https://github.com/atsign-company/labels">labels</a> and open sourced
                that too.</p>
            
            <p>We have had a number of requests to be able to run a privately hosted secondary server, as well as use
                different CPU architectures. We have now been able to show the secondary code running on both ARM and
                ARM64 as well as the current x86. For those of you with Raspberry PI&rsquo;s: Yes, you can run a
                secondary on a PI 2/3/4! We are also working on a set of instructions for people to run their own
                secondary and we will be adding the option to self host on the registrar site.</p>
            
            <p>In layman's terms, it is now easier and faster to be knowledgeable about the @protocol and it will now
                integrate into more environments of the developer&rsquo;s own choosing.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you, as always, for your support and please reach out with any questions you may have.</p>
            
            <p>Stay well!</p>
